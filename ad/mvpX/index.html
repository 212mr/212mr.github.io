                            <h6>A classic wind- and water-resistant jacket made of 100% recycled nylon. Fair Trade Certified™ sewn.</h6>
                            <p>68% of our fabrics this season are made with recycled materials. Less than 10% of fibers produced globally are made with recycled materials.
                            </p>

                                    Soft, Water-Resistant Shell is
                                    made of wind- and water-resistant 100% recycled nylon with a polyurethane coating and a DWR finish, lined with a lightweight tricot mesh
                                    Full-length center-front zipper extends through a stand-up collar to block wind and sun.
                                    Handwarmer pockets secure with zippers to hold your everyday essentials.
                                    Raglan sleeves allow full shoulder and arm mobility and reduce chafing under pack straps.
                                    The nylon rib-knit cuffs and hem feel soft and comfortable on the skin.
                                    The waist length stays out of the way for biking, hiking and riding your longboard to work.
                                    Fair Trade Certified™ sewn, which means the people who made it earned a premium for their labor.

                                <h6>Fair Trade & Recycle Materials</h6>
                                <p>83% of our line is Fair Trade Certified™ sewn. That’s more Fair Trade styles than any other apparel brand.</p>
                                We use recycled nylon made from post-industrial waste fiber and discards from weaving mills and postconsumer fishing nets.</p>
                                Our durable water repellent (DWR) finish is a coating added to the fabric of our waterproof/weatherproof garments, which helps moisture bead up and roll off the outer fabric; this prevents soaking from the outside and the user becoming cold, clammy or wet, which could be life-threatening in extreme conditions.
                                <p>Polyester is naturally water repellent and performs well in the outdoors. We’re trying to decrease our dependence on petroleum as a source of raw materials, so we have dramatically increased our use of recycled polyester.  Our goal is to completely move away from using virgin polyester by 2025.</p>
