               <h1>Design Test from Baytech</h1>
                <hr>
                <h3>1. How would you organize the site structure if the client says he wants these pages on the site?</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="../images/baytech/1b.svg" alt="1"></span>

                <h3>2. Please draw out the layout for a homepage which has these components?</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="../images/baytech/webTwo2.png" alt="2"></span>

                <h3>3. Please draw or list out all the components that should go on a "product detail" page for example if I am going to buy  Nike Running Shoe - what components would be on that page?</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="../images/baytech/3b.svg" alt="3"></span>

                <h3>4. Please describe in details the workflow of how a user would shop on an e-commerce site?</h3>
                <span class="image fit"><img src="../images/baytech/4c.svg" alt="4"></span>

                <h3>5. For an e-commerce website, what kind of functionality should be included inside a user's account portal?</h3>
                <p>- my account: address / payment / passwords <br>
                   - my orders: order tracking / returns <br>
                    - my favourite list <br>
                    - subscription & membership: membership credits / coupons <br>
                </p>


                <h3>6. For a corporate website, what would be the most important things a corporate client may need to have control over (from the administration perspective)? </h3>
                <p>- Timeline / Milestone: when a corporate is working with vendors, a timeline is one thing they must control.
                    <br>
                    - Budgets: details of spending and costs. <br>
                    - Contact info of each customer (a corporate must prevent their customers from being stolen by others).
                    <br>
                    - Collect data and order records of each customer in case the corporate grows into a big data business and the data could be valuable.
                    <br>
                    - Clear, correct and appealing products' content on websites or in stores. <br>
                    - Tracking the sales records, warehouse inventory or logistics on an efficient dashboard software.
                    <br>
                </p>

                <h3>7. For a corporate website, what are the most important elements/functionality of the website from a user perspective (in other words a user most need to get from the site)?</h3>
                <p>
                    Users want the products to be deliverable on a website. The content should be presented in a clear and easy-to-follow manner from knowing the product to placing payment.
                </p>

                <h3>8. A client called in and he wants a website with online shopping features. Please provide a brief list here.</h3>
                <p>A whole solution of an online shopping website needs to include two major parts: <br>
                    A front-end website that users can interact and make the purchase. We can present the client with the following detailed design, workflow or wireframe:<br>
                    - Main page (including brand introduction, logo, navigations, product categories, deals and promotions, social network links)<br>
                    - My Account: sign-up/login page (including payment, address, password, etc.), My Orders (including tracking, return, history)<br>
                    - Product page (including detailed spec, comparison, recommendations, reviews,  etc.)<br>
                    - Cart/Checkout page (including discount/coupon, payment, shipping)<br>
                    <br><br>
                    A back-end website that manages the business and controls the content of the front-end website.<br>
                    - User info database (credit card, password, security protection)<br>
                    - Inventory management (product adding/removing, shipping, tracking, out-of-stock warning, etc)<br>
                    - Marketing management (for marketing team to update deals, promotions, incentives)<br>
                    - Accounting/Finance management (income/cost monitoring)<br>
                    - Customer service management (for customer service desk to handle return/change orders)<br>

                </p>

                <h3>9. Please describe the difference between a blog and a forum.</h3>
                <p>A blog is for one writer or company to update his information/content to show others. <br>
                    A forum is for many people to exchange information/content in groups.
                </p>

                <h3>10. For an e-commerce website, what kind of features that you would recommend to your client if the goal of the website is to increase the sales?</h3>
                <p>The website needs to look appealing with an efficient user experience. The website needs to show seasonal promotions, membership benefits, coupon codes, and return policy. The website also needs to monitor traffics by using tools like Google Analytics .</p>

                <h3>11. Your client has three concepts in mind and for creating a new social networking. The three options will be the combined feature from "A. Facebook + Craigslist"; "B. Instagram + LinkedIn"; "C. Twitter + ebay + Craigslist".
                    <br>Which direction/concept would you recommend and why?</h3>
                <p>
                    Without knowing the actual nature of the business, it is difficult to choose among these three options. "B. Instagram + LinkedIn" seems like a typical social network combination for corporate brands.
                </p>

                <h3>12. Which one is a better design and why?</h3>
                <p>A. "special offer" is more appealing to customers and the button content is a clearer explanation of the next step.</p>
